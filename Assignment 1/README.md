## ✨ Project Features

### 🧩 RockPaperScissor5.jac
- Interactive command-line game  
- Walker-based agent accepts user input (“rock”, “paper”, “scissors”)  
- Game logic for determining winner, tie, or loser  
- Randomized computer choice each round  
- Clear result feedback after every round  

### 🤖 RockPaperScissor6.jac
- AI-powered enhancement using **LLM (Groq Llama 3.1)**  
- Smart response generator: after each round, a GenAI assistant delivers context-aware commentary  
- Seamless integration with classic game logic  
- Showcases how to blend deterministic logic and generative intelligence  

---

## 🎮 How to Play
1. Run either `.jac` file in your **Jaseci-enabled environment**.  
2. Enter your move when prompted (`rock`, `paper`, or `scissors`).  
3. See who wins — **player or computer!**  
4. If using `RockPaperScissor6`, experience smart insights and feedback powered by AI.
